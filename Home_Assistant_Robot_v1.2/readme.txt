This is an Arduino based Robotics project. Here I included the source code of the latest version 1.3 of my Robo.
This is a static project to run the four wheeler bot according to the command sent through the remote to go from
one room to another room. 

We assumed there four rooms and assumed there respective door coordinates. If the number of any room is pressed 
in the remote then the robot will automatically come from one room to another room. If the robot is on the i'th 
room and i'th switch pressed then no change of the possition will be occured. 

This project will be further developed to work under dynamic map installment for different maps of different 
homes.
